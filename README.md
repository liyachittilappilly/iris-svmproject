# 🌸 Iris Classification using SVM

> Wrapped up a project on the Iris dataset using Support Vector Machines (SVM) — implemented both binary and multi-class classification, visualized decision boundaries, and explored model tuning strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying the famous **Iris flower dataset** using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The goal was to experiment with:

- Binary vs. Multi-class classification
- Kernel selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Decision boundary visualization
- Evaluating performance metrics

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How SVM handles linearly and non-linearly separable data
- The math behind decision boundaries and support vectors
- Using one-vs-rest strategy for multi-class SVM
- Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D with PCA

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`
- `numpy` & `pandas`
